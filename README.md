# IR-Door-Lock-TI-MSP430
Very old piece of code I found from my high school days. 

It basically worked like this:
  IF IR OPEN_CODE recieved:
    change actuator to OPEN state
  ELSE IF CLOSE_CODE recieved:
    change actuator to CLOSE state
    
The code itself represents both OPEN and CLOSE states as forward and back but the logic still applies the same.
This was made when I was about 15 years old - I got the inspiration from watching spiderman and was my first project where I said to myself that I wasn't allowed to simply follow a youtube tutorial and actually try and figure this out myself. 

I never managed to install the lock itself but the system actually worked - of course being in computing science now my electronics knowledge has slightly faded to make room for new concepts into programming itself.

Nevertheless I learnt alot from this little project and after this I eventually constructed a 50Watt Briefcase Speaker which was probably one of the most practicle electronics projects I ever made and completed.
